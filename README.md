# ReactJS &amp; JavaScript

Run the following command to get a basic ReactJS application setup:

```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
yarn start
```

1. Inside the my-app/src/App.js add an arrow function named someValue before the render() that returns a string.

2. Inside the render() function, set a constant variable equal to this.someValue.

3. Replace the words "Welcome to React" with your variable wrapped with a ${ and a }.

4. View the page that was opened during the setup to see the results of your changes.

5. Create two arrays in the someValue function, then combine them using a spread operator.

6. Create an object in the someValue function, then use object deconstructing to pull one of the values and return it.

7. Use some of the array functions on the arrays created in step 5.

8. Use what you have learned about fetch before to put a fetch call inside of the someValue function, try to have it return the results.

After you have completed all of the exercises, commit your changes with the following command:

```
git commit -am "ReactJS JavaScript Examples"
```
